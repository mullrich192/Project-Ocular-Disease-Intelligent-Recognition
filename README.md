# Project-Ocular-Disease-Intelligent-Recognition
Project in the context of the course "Artificial vision" at the UPV in Valencia.

A detailed description of the code along with the findings can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
ODIR is a database of 5,000 patients with eye diseases. It includes information about their age, photographs of the back of their eyes (called fundus photographs), and the words used by doctors to describe their diagnoses.
This dataset is meant to represent ‘‘real-life’’ set of patient information collected by Shanggong Medical Technology Co., Ltd. from different hospitals/medical centers in China. 
Annotations were labeled by trained human readers with quality control management. They classify patient into eight labels including:

Normal (N),
Diabetes (D),
Glaucoma (G),
Cataract (C),
Age related Macular Degeneration (A),
Hypertension (H),
Pathological Myopia (M),
Other diseases/abnormalities (O)

## Project objective
This project aims to develop a classification model for fundus diseases with creating a robust classifier capable of accurately categorizing the given images into multiple disease types.
